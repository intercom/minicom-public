# Spring

This is the Spring backend for Minicom.

The minimum JDK version required to run the server is version 21

There's nothing to be done here for the interview set-up, but feel free to look around! ðŸ‘€

## Setup

The start command runs any setup scripts you need.

## Starting the server

From the project root run `script/spring/start`

## Database

This project uses an in-memory database called H2.

Access the database by navigating to http://localhost:3000/h2-console/login.jsp. The current schema and creation commands are located in `schema.sql`. To update the tables, you will have to run similar SQL commands directly in the console.

### Database credentials

If the setup script doesn't prepopulate the correct URL, be sure to use the one below.

_url_: `jdbc:h2:file:~/minicom`

_username_: `sa`

(no password)
